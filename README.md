# InfoBot
to run: make sure Bot_Memory.csv is clear, run infoTrain.py, then start infoBot.py

to operate: start out by giving a name, say something like "hi, im /name/" or "my name is /name/', you can than say things like "my favorite color is red" or "my favorite animal is a pig"

currently its only tags are: favorite food, favorite color, favorite animal, least favorite food, least favorite color, and least favorite animal
